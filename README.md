# wordtemplesite

This repository will host the public site for WordTemple (static files) and the `app-ads.txt` file used for AdMob verification.

- `index.html` — simple landing page
- `app-ads.txt` — required AdMob file

Instructions:
1. Create a repository on GitHub named `wordtemplesite` (public).
2. Push these files to the `main` branch and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: `main / (root)`).
3. In Google Play Console, set the developer Website to: `https://ianswiis.github.io/wordtemplesite/` and click "Check for updates" to verify `app-ads.txt`.

If you want the WordTemple project sources to remain private, this repository should only contain built static files and `app-ads.txt`.
